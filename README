lmc
===

My implementation of the [Little Man Computer][1]. My friend inspired me to
write an implementation of this for academic purposes, and I had a joy writing
it.

I finished the first implementation in 2 days (really one day had I started
early in the morning). I intend to make a few improvements over time.

Usage
-----

`lmc` can execute code assembled with `lmasm`. I've included a test program
with this software. You can assemble it like so:

    $ lmasm square.lma square.lexe

This will create the binary program `square.lexe` which `lmc` understands.

    $ lmc square.lexe

This test program will square any number you input. Input `0` to quit. Note
that the LMC can only handle numbers up to 999, so any number higher than 31
will overflow and give an incorrect result, but this is a limitation of the
system.
